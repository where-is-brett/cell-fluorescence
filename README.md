# Measure Corrected Total Cell Fluorescence
Simple &amp; efficient MATLAB app for corrected total cell fluorescence (CTCF) measurements.

### Note
The ROIs for cells and background should be drawn in an alternating fashion, beginning with a cell. That is, "Cell 1-> Background 1 -> Cell 2 -> Background 2 …”. The ROI Labeller will remind you of which type you ought to delineate next.

### Acknowledgement
I would like to acknowledge that the UI design of ROI Laballer component was inspired on a MATLAB handle subclass written by Jonas Reber (2011). I have improved and adapted part of Reber's code to this application.
